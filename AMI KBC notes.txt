The AMI '8' keyboard controller does return a copyright string but the string is not terminated with a 0x00.

The copyright string dumping likely scans the keyboard and/or mouse during the dumping, similar to command ACh
(Diagnostic dump) of the IBM AT keyboard controller, as evidenced by a 1994 MegaKey copyright string with a
stray FAh from the keyboard.
